                <h2>The pre-game</h2>
                <p>You're staring at the clock, counting down the seconds. How could 3 minutes take this long? You get impatient, thinking maybe it will be ready early, but something deep down tells you to just keep waiting because you know its important to wait the full time before grabbing it. No, this isn't your ramen cooking in the microwave, its so much more life changing than satisfying your midnight hunger after getting home from work. After these 3 agonizingly long minutes, you will finally know if that heightened sense of smell, or the constant queasiness that your significant other is feeling, is because of a baby or the sketchy Mexican restaurant you ate at a few days ago. You have been getting excited thinking about starting a family the past few months, you and your SO have been discussing it for even longer. You two finally decided to get serious, and bite the bullet. Now it comes down the these final 3 minutes to find out what your next steps are, plan a trip to the doctor, or consider trying again during the next conception window? You start getting worried, thinking about what your family will think, and if you actually have what it takes to raise a child. The alarm you set finally goes off, and you both almost jump up to look at the test. It reads two parallel red bars, and you check the instructions on the box for the 12th time to make sure that the double bars means positive. You two embrace, confident and excited about the baby that is on its way.</p>
                <p>Fast forward 8 months, to your baby shower. You and your SO are surrounded by your best friends and most of your family. They are sharing their excitement of the baby that is almost here, while you eat cake and open the gifts everyone got you. You think back to how challenging it has been so far. All of the doctors appointments, the mood swings from both of you, the pregnancy weight you both have gains from the constant flow of new snack foods in the house. You think back to all of that, but are confident you made the right decision. And now that you have the backing of the closest people in your life, and all of the baby equipment anyone would ever need, you feel a little more ready for the new baby to come. Granted your list of things to do gets longer by the day, but in this moment, you and your SO are ready.</p>

                <h2>The Early Game</h2>
                <p>Its been over 20 hours since your SO was admitted to the hospital. Almost a day ago you received the call from her that its go time, the baby is coming. You two have prepped for this. You have a hospital bag with everything from snacks, to the baby's first outfit, to the list and order of people you are going to call to see the baby when it is here. But now, the baby is here. Your SO finished her battle to birth the newborn, and you both get a chance to see the baby before the nurses have to take her to check her stats and clean her up. The aftermath is a lot different that what tv depicts. The doctors are still there with your SO because her part of the birthing process is not over. You have an internal struggle of whether to stay with your SO or to be with your new born, as your instincts are telling you both need to be watched over and taken care of. Eventually all three of you are left in the hospital room together as the dozen or so support staff leave one by one, and your nurse tells you she will be checking in soon. You are at peace with your small, new family as you watch the extremely tired baby sleep. You want to sleep as well since its been over a day since your slept last, but there is family coming that allwant to see the new born, and you both are still wired with adrenaline.</p>
                <p>Fast forward 2 days, you are released from the hospital as the nurse hands you the discharge papers. You have been packed up for hours, waiting for the moment to get home and to your own bed. You make sure to get stocked up on the hospital supplies they give you, since, after all, you are paying for all of this at some point soon. On the car ride home you wonder how the doctors let you leave with the baby. What makes your qualified to raise another human? You get nervous that the car seat isn't placed right and that some monster will coming crashing into your car. You exhale louded when you pull into your driveway knowing you made it home intact with the newest addition to the family.</p>

                <h2>The Long Haul</h2>
                <p>It has been a few weeks since you all came home from the hospital. You and your SO are both constantly exhausted, and it might be affecting your relationship. House work is piling up, and this baby is making an unhuman amount of poop. Just remember that this is a long road your are on, so there is no need to make any rash decisions in the heat of the moment. You will find a routine, the baby will start sleeping through the night, and you will feel normal again. Be kind to your partner with the little things, like picking up some of the chores, letting her sleep, etc. Remember to work as a team rather than against eachother.</p>
